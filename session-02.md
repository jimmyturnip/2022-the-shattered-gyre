## Setup

    What is Buzzard looking for in the Maelstrom? Roll descriptor and focus.
    Functional, data. She's looking for some kind of data chip.

    Let's generate some details about Buzzard herself. What kind of person
    is she?

    First look: Wiry
    Role: Scholar
    Goal: Discover a truth
    Revealed Aspect: Ambitious

    So, unlike most of the Maelstrom scavengers, she's more interested in
    finding a particular thing than in making a profit. The thing she's
    looking for is knowledge, particularly about the precursors themselves.
    Her motivation is selfish; she simply wants to be the first person to
    uncover the truth about the precursors.

Albatross and Buzzard set off deeper into the Maelstrom to find Buzzard's data chip.






## Gameplay

    Begin a Session. No flags to be set. Recapped last session. Set the current
    scene. Spotlight new insight: Flashback reveals an aspect of your
    background or nature (then +1 momentum).

    How does flashback start? Roll action and theme. Search, knowledge.

Albatross sits in the cockpit of the Sparrowhawk as the ship drifts a few hundred thousand clicks from Pinnacle. It's peaceful here, no one bothers coming out on this vector much. But he likes it. It means he can monitor transmissions in peace.

Sorsha purrs ask he strokes her head. It took a while for her to trust him after... Best not to think about that, just gets his stomach in knots. "Revenge is a dish best served cold". He never really understood that expression until now. Keep feelings out of it. Slow, methodical, surgical. Plot and plan. Do your research. Then, when the moment's right, that's when you strike.

    Apart from the ambush on Buzzard, what has he learnt about the Fire Talons?
    Roll descriptor and focus. Untamed, vault.

What he has learnt from the chatter is that there's a particular precursor vault that Zephyr is interested in. How does he know? He knows enough of the Talons' callsigns and code words to piece things together. What he doesn't know is where the vault is, or what Zephyr's interest in it could be. Maybe it's a weapon, or a propulsion system, or a trove of scrap that would fetch a fortune.

Precursor vaults. No good ever came of messing with the past. Best to let sleeping giants lie.
