**System**: Starforged  
**GME**: Starforged  
**Characters**: Kylar "Albatross" Thorn  


## Summary

Before continuing where we left of, we have a flashback moment with Kylar monitoring transmissions near Pinnacle and contemplating his revenge against the Fire Talon pirates. We discover that their leader, Zephyr, also has an interest in the precursor vaults.

Back in the present, Kylar and Brianna return to the *Sparrowhawk* and lay a course towards the centre of the Maelstrom. The expedition to the next precursor vault goes smoothly, and Brianna tends to Kylar's wounds and reveals more about her interest in the vaults. We discover that she is no ordinary scavenger, but a scholar with an intense interest in discovering more about the Maelstrom. She needs to get into one of the vaults whose function appears to be data storage, and thanks to Kylar's rescue, she has a key to get into it.

As the *Sparrowhawk* nears one of these data vaults, its automated defense systems kick in, and there's a thrilling dogfight as Kylar tries to evade its weapons. He manages, but not without the ship taking damage, or Buzzard being hurt.

Still, they've made it, and now need to find their way in. The matter of the pirates, however, is far from over...

## Setup

    What is Buzzard looking for in the Maelstrom? Roll descriptor and focus.
    Functional, data. She's looking for some kind of data chip.

    Let's generate some details about Buzzard herself. What kind of person
    is she?

    First look: Wiry
    Role: Scholar
    Goal: Discover a truth
    Revealed Aspect: Ambitious

    So, unlike most of the Maelstrom scavengers, she's more interested in
    finding a particular thing than in making a profit. The thing she's
    looking for is knowledge, particularly about the precursors themselves.
    Her motivation is selfish; she simply wants to be the first person to
    uncover the truth about the precursors.

Albatross and Buzzard set off deeper into the Maelstrom to find Buzzard's data chip.






## Gameplay

    Begin a Session. No flags to be set. Recapped last session. Set the current
    scene. Spotlight new insight: Flashback reveals an aspect of your
    background or nature (then +1 momentum).

    How does flashback start? Roll action and theme. Search, knowledge.

Albatross sits in the cockpit of the *Sparrowhawk* as the ship drifts a few hundred thousand clicks from Pinnacle. It's peaceful here, no one bothers coming out on this vector much. But he likes it. It means he can monitor transmissions in peace.

Sorsha purrs ask he strokes her head. It took a while for her to trust him after... Best not to think about that, just gets his stomach in knots. "Revenge is a dish best served cold". He never really understood that expression until now. Keep feelings out of it. Slow, methodical, surgical. Plot and plan. Do your research. Then, when the moment's right, that's when you strike.

    Apart from the ambush on Buzzard, what has he learnt about the Fire Talons?
    Roll descriptor and focus. Untamed, vault.

What he has learnt from the chatter is that there's a particular precursor vault that Zephyr is interested in. How does he know? He knows enough of the Talons' callsigns and code words to piece things together. What he doesn't know is where the vault is, or what Zephyr's interest in it could be. Maybe it's a weapon, or a propulsion system, or a trove of scrap that would fetch a fortune.

Precursor vaults. No good ever came of messing with the past. Best to let sleeping giants lie.

---



    Buzzard's insistence on exploring more precursor ruins before they return
    to Pinnacle has set back Kylar's vow, so I'll change it from Dangerous to
    Formidable.

The *Sparrowhawk's* airlock repressurises with a hiss, and Buzzard helps Albatross remove his suit. He groans in pain.

> BUZZARD  
> We need to get you patched up.

> KYLAR  
> We need to get the hell out of here.

He wasn't wrong. The Fire Talons could descend on them any minute. He staggers off to the bridge.

> KYLER  
> Computer, lay in a course. Deeper into the Maelstrom.

> COMPUTER  
> Warning! Sector-wide amber alert on that trajectory.

> KYLAR  
> Yeah, yeah, I know. Just do it, please.

The ship's computer gives a compliant chirp.

    Undertake an Expedition.
    Journey to Buzzard's precursor vault. Dangerous.
    Stay vigilant. Roll +wits. [7, 1] vs 9. Strong hit. Reach waypoint, mark
    progress.

    Journey to Buzzard's precursor vault [#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

As the *Sparrowhawk* emerges from a dense area of swirling detritus, Albatross and Buzzard take in the view. This close to the Maelstrom core, it's possible to make out the faint disk shape painted against the black void. Trillions of tons of debris from an alien *something*. There are theories about what the Maelstrom was. Theories include an artificial world, a giant factory, or some kind of super weapon. The people who are paying for recovery aren't scholars and thinkers, though. They're businesspeople, just interested in the scrap value of all this tech. Maybe we'll never know what this was, what was here.

> BUZZARD  
> Medkit. Let's at least try and fix you up a little.

    Heal. Receive treatment from someone. Roll +iron. [1, 8] vs 4. Weak hit.
    +3 health, but recovery takes time, -2 momentum.

As soon as Buzzard is done with her treatment, Kylar drifts off into a healing sleep.

    Expedition. Stay vigilant. Roll +wits. [1, 7] vs 9. Strong hit. Reach
    waypoint, mark progress.

    Journey to Buzzard's precursor vault [#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Kylar awakens to see Buzzard hunched over his computer console. He creeps over.

> KYLAR  
> What are you doing?

Buzzard doesn't flinch.

> BUZZARD  
> Scans.

> KYLAR  
> Do you know what you're looking for?

> BUZZARD  
> Maybe.

> KYLAR  
> How?

    Has Buzzard been to similar vaults before? Ask oracle. Likely. 15. Yes.

> BUZZARD  
> The Maelstrom is made up of all kinds of objects, but they're not just scrap, like some people would have us believe. There's a pattern. OK, most of the objects are useless, but some... some follow a pattern. We've found transmitters, at least what we think are transmitters. And capacitors. And what we think are engines. And maybe weapons. And they're not just random; there are templates that they follow. I've found a few vaults that followed the same template for a data bank or library. I've never managed to get inside one, but I think I might be able to now. See, that's what I was looking for when you found me. And I think I have it.

She reaches into a pocket and draws out a disk-shaped object.

> KYLAR  
> A key?

> BUZZARD  
> I'm sure of it.

> KYLAR  
> Can we go to one of your previous vaults and take a look around?

> BUZZARD  
> That's where we're going. Sorry, when you were sleeping, I took the liberty of uploading a few landmarks within the Maelstrom to your ship's computer. We can't be certain of their exact position; objects in the Maelstrom are always on the move. But we can take a good guess. I've run some calculations, and I'm pretty sure we're close. Just gotta keep searching.

Kylar thinks for a moment.

> KYLAR  
> What if there are dangers in there, like that place I found you? Assuming we manage to get in, we could need a gunship full of marines to deal with whatever's inside.

> BUZZARD  
> We'll see. Look, at least let me take a peek. If I can open it, well, that's something. Mimic and Basilisk won't have given their lives in vain.

He can't argue with that. He nods slowly, and she turns back to the console.

    Expedition. Stay vigilant. Roll +wits. [5, 1] vs 6. Strong hit. Reach
    waypoint, mark progress.

    Journey to Buzzard's precursor vault [#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    What's the nature of this waypoint? Roll descriptor and focus. Fragile,
    viewpoint.

The debris field gets thicker as they proceed, but there's still an amazing view.

> BUZZARD  
> Incredible, isn't it? Have you been this far in before?

Kylar shakes his head.

> KYLAR  
> They always said it's impossible to navigate.

> BUZZARD  
> It is for a lot of people. But you need to stretch your boundaries. Besides, maybe the reason they say that is because the know there's something here. Something big.

Kylar scoffs.

> KYLAR  
> You think? 

> BUZZARD  
> Maybe. Or maybe they don't want to, you know, "let sleeping giants lie", was it?

She gives him a challenging look, but he just turns his attention back to the view around them. He never went in for that kind of crypto talk, but he couldn't help but feel a rush at the possibilities. Sorsha next to him strobed pearl white and brushed her tail against his leg.

    Speaking of which, can Kylar tell from the glowcat whether Buzzard is
    lying or hiding anything?

    Secure an Advantage. Roll +wits, +Sorsha's health (+6 total). [1, 3] vs 7.
    Strong hit. +2 momentum, +1 to next move.

    Is she lying? Unlikely. 51. No.

Kylar hasn't told Buzzard about the cat. Not yet. Since he took over the care of his companion, she's come in quite useful, and he's become fairly adept at reading the patterns in her coat. So far, nothing unexpected has come up when she's entangled herself around Buzzard's feet. Excitement, nervousness, anticipation. He avoids glancing at the cat too often in case he gives her away.

    Expedition. Stay vigilant. Roll +wits, +1 from previous roll. [2, 2] vs 5.
    Strong hit with match. Reach waypoint, mark progress.

    Journey to Buzzard's precursor vault [#][#][#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ]

    What's the opportunity? Roll action and theme. Aid, technology.

> BUZZARD  
> I took a look at your suit, by the way.

    Resupply. Craft, roll +wits. [4, 2] vs 7. Strong hit. Take +2 supply.

> BUZZARD  
> Should be good as new. I had a few knick-knacks with me as well that it looks like you could use. I'm curious how you've managed all this time without a decent flashlight. Wait, is that...?

She turns back to the console.

    Finish an Expedition. Progress move. [6, 2] vs 8. Strong hit. Mark two
    ticks on discoveries legacy track.

    Reach a milestone for returning Buzzard back to Pinnacle. Mark one box.

The ship's sensor pings as the *Sparrowhawk* draws close to the object before them.

    Let's set a few details about this vault. It's probably a bit different
    from the last one, but might have some things in common.
    Location: Deep Space
    Scale: Minor, confined site
    Form: Monument
    Shape: Geometric (torus)
    Material: Metallic (industrial)
    Outer first look: Automated defenses

As the *Sparrowhawk* approaches the doughnut-shaped structure, there's movement. Lights appear across its surface, and coalesce at a single point, whereupon a laser blast is targetted at the ship.

    Enter the Fray. The data vault is dangerous. Caught in a trap, so roll
    +wits. [1, 9] vs 9. Weak hit. You are in control.

As if he knew what was about to happen, Kylar switched to manual controls just before the beam erupted from the object. He swung the ship round in an evasive manoeuvre.

> KYLAR  
> Did it do that last time?

    Did it? 50/50. 2. Yes.

> BUZZARD  
> Sorry, I forgot to mention it. It's OK, there's a way through.

Kylar pilots the ship to where Buzzard indicates.

    Gain Ground. Manoeuvring, so roll +edge. [4, 10] vs 6. Weak hit. Stay in
    control and mark progress.

    Evading data vault's defenses [#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Kylar flies the ship behind some nearby debris, which shatters when the laser hits. Better some debris than his precious ship.

    Gain Ground. Roll +edge. [4, 10] vs 8. Weak hit. Stay in control and mark
    progress.

    Evading data vault's defenses [#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

More hotshot piloting as Kylar moves the ship lower, underneath the angry doughnut.

> BUZZARD  
> They're only coming from the outside, see? We want to be in the middle.

    Gain Ground. Roll +edge. [5, 9] vs 3. Miss. I'll burn momentum (+6) to turn
    it into a weak hit. Stay in control and mark progress.

    Evading data vault's defenses [#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ]

> BUZZARD  
> Damn, that was close...

    Gain Ground. Roll +edge. [5, 1] vs 7. Strong hit. Stay in control, mark
    progress and take +2 momentum.

Kylar performs some more ace manoeuvring as the lasers sear past.

    Gain Ground. Roll +edge. [7, 9] vs 6. Miss. In a bad spot, foe gains upper
    hand, and pay the price. Your vehicle suffers damage. Of course it does!
    Withstand damage (-1 for dangerous foe). Ship takes -1 integrity.

One of the laser beams hits the hull of the *Sparrowhawk*, and the computer console blares red in warning.

> BUZZARD  
> OK, not like that...

    React Under Fire. Dodging, so roll +edge. [1, 1] vs 6. Strong hit with
    match. Succeed, are in control and take +1 momentum.

Kylar passes close to another hunk of debris, which the laser destroys.

> BUZZARD  
> More like it!

    Gain Ground. Roll +edge. [8, 8] vs 4. Miss with match. In a bad spot, foe
    gains upper hand, and pay the price. Something of value is lost or
    destroyed.
    Does his datapad get smashed? 50/50. 71. No.
    Does the ship lose its e-drive? 50/50. 27. Yes.

> COMPUTER  
> Warning! E-drive compromised.

> KYLAR  
> Shit, shit, shit!

> BUZZARD  
> Albatross, we can't take another hit like that.

    Since I roll a match, I'll say the ship takes -2 damage as well.

> KYLAR  
> OK, we need a plan B. Do you trust me?

Before Buzzard answers, Kylar has manoeuvred the ship next to a nearby asteroid.

> BUZZARD  
> Landing gear, really?

> KYLAR  
> Trust me.

The landing gear unfolds, but Kylar has no intention of setting down. Instead, there's a crash as the landing gear skims the surface of the asteroid. It could be just enough to set it off course.

    React Under Fire. Roll +wits. [5, 10] vs 7. Weak hit. Make a suffer move
    (-1), and stay in a bad spot.
    Lose Momentum. -1.

It isn't enough. Instead, Kylar is forced to backtrack.

> BUZZARD  
> Albatross, what the hell are you doing?

He directs the ship straight towards the interior of the toroidal vault.

> KYLAR  
> Hang on...

    Take Decisive Action. Progress Move. [1, 5] vs 6. Strong hit, but counts 
    as a weak hit. Others pay the price: Someone else suffers the cost.
    Does Buzzard get hurt? 50/50. 36. Yes.

Kylar engages the ship's fore thrusters and the vehicle comes to a stop right where he needs it to be. But the artifical gravity can't compensate for the intense momentum, and Buzzard is thrown forward against the console.

    Although she's not a companion, the Sidekick asset has a health track of 4.
    Let's say that she takes -2 health.

    Buzzard's health: 4 [x] 3 [x] 2 [ ] 1 [ ] Out of Action [ ]

Kylar knows it's serious by the lack of protest. An ominous gurgling sound comes from his fellow scavenger. He grabs a medkit and carefully lifts her head.

    Heal. Provide care, so roll +wits. [10, 5] vs 8. Weak hit. She takes +3
    health, but...
    Lose Momentum. -2.

It takes an hour or so before Buzzard regains consciousness. She groans, just as he'd done a few hours earlier.

> BUZZARD  
> Wow, that sure was some piloting.

Kylar smiles apologetically. They both turn to the view screen to look at the alien structure outside.

    End a Session. I have 2 XP, so I'll spend it now on improving the Glowcat
    asset.

    I've learnt more about Buzzard's plans and helped her achieve them, so...

    Develop Your Relationship. Mark two boxes on connection track with Buzzard.

    Reach a milestone on returning Buzzard to Pinnacle. Mark one box.

    Next session will definitely involve current quests and connections, so +1
    momentum.

    What dangers await the heroes inside the data vault? Will Buzzard find what
    she's looking for? And what are those pirates up to? Find out next time!
