## Summary

Kylar "Albatross" Thorn intercepts a transmission from the Fire Talons, the pirate clan he's sworn revenge on. From the transmission, he learns that they're planning to ambush a fellow scavenger, Brianna "Buzzard" Keelan. Kylar swears to warn her before the pirates can get to her.

He begins searching for her ship, and after a few setbacks, he finds it deep in the Maelstrom, drifting crewless near a precursor vault. Figuring the crew has gone into the vault, Kylar follows. There are many dangers inside, including pools of acid and former members of Buzzard's crew that have been turned into slavering mutants. He eventually finds Buzzard and goes head-to-head with one of the mutants. Finally, he destroys the creature - and himself almost - by smashing it with an alien device he found in the ruin.

When they're out of immediate danger, Kylar swears to get Buzzard back to Pinnacle Station. She agrees to abandon her ship to the Fire Talons and come with him, but not before she's found what she's looking for in the Maelstrom.

## Setup

While exploring the Maelstrom for scrap, Kylar intercepts a signal from the Fire Talons. They've located the ship of Brianna "Buzzard" Keelan, a fellow scavenger, and are setting an ambush. Kylar intends to find her ship and warn her.






## Gameplay

    Begin a Session. I don't need to do anything other than set the scene,
    which I've already done.

The signal from the Fire Talons ends. Kylar regards Sorsha for a moment. She looks up at him, sensing the rage and fear within him, and cascades of orange and blue flash through her fur. She nuzzles Kylar's hand and he swears. He takes out the iron blade at his hilt.

> KYLAR  
> If you're out there, Buzzard, I swear those bastards won't find you. Not if I can help it.

    Swear and Iron Vow. The vow is to warn Brianna of the Fire Talons' ambush.
    Roll +heart +1 (for connection to Brianna). [4, 10] vs 8. Weak hit. Take +1
    momentum.

    I'll also set up a 10-segment tension clock:
    Fire Talons' Ambush clock [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

He swings his chair around and begins a scan of the area.

    Gather Information. Roll +wits. [7, 9] vs 6. Miss. Pay the Price. You are
    delayed or put at a disadvantage. I'll lose momentum.

He waits anxiously while the sensors do their thing, but apart from the usual pings from nearby scrap, there's nothing on the radar.

> KYLAR  
> Shit. Computer, spin up the engines and set a course towards Maelstrom hub.

> SHIP  
> Warning, sector-wide amber alert on that trajectory. Please confirm.

> KYLAR  
> Confirmed. Just do it, will you?

> SHIP  
> Plotting course.

    Set a Course. Roll +supply. [9, 7] vs 7. Miss. This will certainly involve
    another delay, so I'll advance the ambush clock:

    Fire Talons' Ambush clock [#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    Roll on Pay the Price table. The environment or terrain introduces a new
    hazard. Roll on action and theme tables. Attack, health.

After a few hours of travel, a warning light appears on the control panel.

> SHIP  
> Warning. Detection of ultra-high radiation levels in local vicinity. Hull protection insufficient. Advise immediate evasive action.

> KYLAR  
> Yes, do it, do it!

> SHIP  
> Please provide new trajectory.

> KYLAR  
> I don't know, away from the radiation hazard.

> SHIP  
> Do you wish to reverse course?

Kylar hesitates. If he reverses course, he might not reach Brianna in time. If he goes through the radiation hazard, it could be bad for both him and his glowcat.

> KYLAR  
> No. Increase speed and push through the radiation hazard.

He grabs Sorsha's carry case and puts her in, to her cries of protest. He hopes that will give her some extra protection. Meanwhile, he dons his space suit.

    Face Danger. This is to see how well he withstands the journey through the
    radiation hazard. Roll +iron. [2, 9] vs 5. Weak hit.

    Endure Harm. He suffers -1 health. I won't bother resisting.

Every second of the journey through the radiation field feels like an eternity, but the Sparrowhawk's sensors finally indicated that they've reached safety. He grabs a medkit and swallows a few anti-rad pills. He'll have to deal with the consequences when he gets back to Pinnacle Station. Just one of the hazards of travel in the Maelstrom.

He makes another sensor sweep for signs of Brianna's ship.

    Gather Information. Roll +wits. [7, 1] vs 7. Weak hit. +1 momentum.
    I'll mark progress on the vow
    Find and warn Brianna Keelan [#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

There's a ping on the radar, but...

    Roll on descriptor and focus oracles. Barren, ship.

He changes course to intercept. The ship is stationary alongside the a large alien structure. He carries out another scan, but there are no life signs aboard Brianna's ship, the Dawn's Herald, and his scans fail to pierce the alien structure. What material is that?

> KYLAR  
> Damn! She's probably in there somewhere.

He manoeuvres the Sparrowhawk next to the Dawn's Herald, and dons his spacesuit again. The airlock depressurises with a hiss, the exterior doors slide open, and Kylar stands on the edge of nothingness.

    We'll say that this structure is a precursor vault and use oracles to 
    generate more details.
    Scale: Typical site, limited scope.
    Form: Vessel.
    Shape: Platform or disc.
    Material: Metallic (smooth).
    First outer look: Broken or fragmented.

He drops down on to the surface of the vault. He breathes a sigh of relief as his magnetic boots grip the metallic surface. Is it iron? There's an access portal a little ways along.

    First inner look: Material does not match exterior. Roll on descriptor and
    focus tables. Foul, liquid.

The interior of the structure has gravity, so he unlocks his magnetic boots. He's in a corridor and there is some foul liquid on the ground. Scoops up some and analyses it with his portable scanner.

    Gather Information. +wits, +1 for Scavenger asset. [9, 4] vs 8. Weak hit.
    +2 momentum, but discovery complicates quest.

The results come through and show a mix of corrosive acids. Kylar begins to pick his way across the corridor, avoiding contact with the pools of acid. He starts scanning for signs of Buzzard.

    Gather Information. +wits. [3, 4] vs 6. Strong hit. +2 momentum.

There's a ping on the bioscanner. That must be her. It's pretty deep inside the structure. He braces himself for a tricky journey.

    Undertake an Expedition. 
    Searching the precursor vault (dangerous): [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    He stays vigilant. Roll +wits. [6, 8] vs 5. Miss.
    Pay the price. You encounter signs of a looming threat.

He hasn't gone far when he comes across a disturbing sight. The helmet from a spacesuit lies on the ground nearby. It's covered in blood. If this is Buzzard's, she's in terrible danger.

    -1 momentum. I'll also advance the ambush clock.

    Fire Talons' Ambush clock [#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

He continues on towards the life signs.

    Move at speed. Roll +edge. [2, 1] vs 4. Strong hit. Mark progress. Reach
    a waypoint.

    Searching the precursor vault (dangerous): [#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    I'll also mark progress on his vow:
    Find and warn Brianna Keelan [#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    Interior feature: Signs of invasive creatures.


The corridor sinks down, then opens into a chamber. Pools of acid dot the uneven floor, and the walls have a weird geometry to them, like an ancient puzzle. His heart skips a beat when he sees it - a severed arm, not human, but some kind of creature. It's thin and gangly, covered in black, almost metallic scales, and ends in sharp-looking claws.

> KYLAR  
> What the hell is in this place?

He presses on towards the signal.

    Move at speed. Roll +edge. [1, 9] vs 3. Weak hit. Mark progress.
    Searching the precursor vault (dangerous): [#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    Make a suffer move (-2). I'll Sacrifice Resources. -2 supply.

He stumbles on, away from the grotesque severed arm, his heartbeat pounding in his chest. He could just go back to his ship. Why risk himself like this for someone he hardly knows, a rival even? No. He swore on iron. Furthermore, he refuses to allow the Fire Talons this victory. He must see Buzzard to safety.

Just then, he trips and falls, right into a pool of acid. He lifts himself out quickly. The foul stuff clings to his suit. Damn! Will it eat through it? He can't afford for that to happen. Best find Buzzard and get out of here as quickly as possible.

    Move at speed. Roll +edge. [10, 7] vs 6. Miss.
    Fire Talons' Ambush clock [#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    Pay the Price. Something of value is lost or destroyed.

As he scrambles over a ridge in the chamber where he is, the unthinkable happens. A red light appears inside his helmet to indicate that his suit is losing pressure.

    I'll set up a 4-segment clock:
    Suit depressurising [ ][ ][ ][ ]

Galloping galaxies! Can he find a tool to fix the leak?

    Check Your Gear. Roll +supply. [3, 3] vs 5. Strong hit with match.
    +1 momentum.
    New opportunity. Roll on action and theme tables. Locate, technology.

He has an aerosol cement in his pack which can temporarily plug punctures in his space suit, but it won't hold for long. As he's working on it, he notices something nearby. A strange device lies on the ground. He doesn't have time to inspect it now, but it could be worth something. Might as well do make use of it. He stashes it in a sack, which he secures to his back.

    Move at speed. Roll +edge. [4, 4] vs 8. Strong hit with match. Mark
    progress.
    Searching the precursor vault (dangerous): [#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    I'll also mark progress on his vow:
    Find and warn Brianna Keelan [#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    Envision location. Roll on sanctum table. Mutated remains of the dead.

Another chamber, another horror. This time, it's a human in a space suit slumped motionless against the bulkhead. He takes a closer look. On the suit is embroidered a call sign. Basilisk. Not Buzzard. As his eyes move up to the helmet, the callsign couldn't be more apt. A man's head has been twisted and distorted into some monstrous parody. One eye bulges, and metallic-looking spines protrude from his shoulder, right through his suit.

There's nothing he can do for this poor soul, so he stumbles on.

    Move at speed. Roll +edge. [1, 2] vs 3. Strong hit. Mark progress.

    Searching the precursor vault (dangerous): [#][#][#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ]

    I'll also mark progress on his vow:
    Find and warn Brianna Keelan [#][#][#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ]

    Envision location. Roll on sanctum table. Repository of biological
    specimens.

He passes through more corridors and into another chamber, and another sickening sight greets him. Along the walls are pods. Many are empty, but some are not. A sickly dim light from within each inhabited pod reveals a creature from his worst nightmares. Sharp-toothed maws, like fish from a lightless ocean; a pair of bulging green eyes; black metallic scaled skin; arms ending in claws of steel. What foul fetuses can these be? Were they once human, or some godless alien waiting for eternity to spring a trap against greedy explorers? Oh gods, please let them not be alive. Kylar stifles a retch before continuing on. Not far now.

    Finish an Expedition. Progress move. [9, 7] vs 8 progress. Weak hit.
    Mark 2 ticks on discovery track.
    Unforeseen complication.

Static comes through his communicator, then a voice. A scream. He rushes ahead into a chamber lit by strobing lights. On the ground, a scuffle is taking place. Two figures in spacesuits, one on the ground, the other looming over it. The one standing up has no helmet. In the strobing light, he can see it's no longer human. Those bulging eyes and the tooth-filled maw. As he enters the room, the creature turns to him as if in slow motion. The figure on the ground takes advantage of the distraction and rolls away. Kylar draws his pistols.

    Enter the Fray. 
    Risen Xenomorph (Formidable).
    I'm facing off, so I'll roll +heart, +1 for Gunslinger asset. [6, 6] vs 6.
    Miss with match. Yikes! I'll burn momentum to turn it into a strong hit
    with match. +2 momentum and I'm in control, +1 momentum for Gunslinger.
    Gunslinger: On a strong hit with a match, you may immediately take a shot
    (without making a move) and mark progress twice.

    Risen Xenomorph [#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

He releases a shot from each, and they strike true, piercing the suit.

    What's the opportunity from the matches? Roll on action and theme tables.
    Reduce, memory.

> BUZZARD  
> Mimic, no! It's me. Please...

The creature formerly called Mimic hesitates for a fraction of a second, and Kylar fires his pistols again.

    Strike. Roll +edge. [4, 9] vs 5. Weak hit. Mark progress twice. In a bad
    spot.

    Risen Xenomorph [#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Kylar fires off another two shots, which again connect, but the creature is angry now. It bounds over and leaps towards him. Kylar tries to dodge out of the way.

    React under Fire. Roll +edge. [10, 3] vs 3. Miss. I'll burn momentum to
    turn it into a weak hit. Make a suffer move (-1).
    Endure Harm. Take -1 health. Now at +3.

Kylar tries to sidestep the creature, but it grabs his leg and he trips to the ground, winding him. He attempts to kick the creature's vice-like claw away from him.

    React under Fire. Roll +iron. [3, 9] vs 6. Weak hit. Make suffer move and
    stay in a bad spot.
    Endure Harm. -1 health. This time, he tries to resist. Roll +health. [5, 3]
    vs 8. Shake it off, +1 health.

He kicks the creature's arm off before it can crush his ankle, and scrambles away. He turns and raises his pistols.

    Clash. Roll +edge. [2, 6] vs 6. Weak hit. Mark progress. Stay in a bad
    spot.

    Risen Xenomorph [#][#][#][#][#][#][#][#][ ][ ]

    Pay the price. You are delayed or put at a disadvantage.

He fires another volley into the creature, which lets out an inhuman howl of pain. In a frenzy, it flies at him. As he tries to fend it off, one of his pistols is thrown out of his hand. He pulls out his iron blade and takes a stab.

    Clash. Roll +iron. [3, 9] vs 7. Weak hit. Mark progress.
    Risen Xenomorph [#][#][#][#][#][#][#][#][#][#]
    Stay in a bad spot. Pay the price. You face the consequences of an earlier
    choice.

He slashes with the knife, which creates a deep gash across the creature's alien face. However, he feels a vibration from something digging into his back and remembers the alien artefact he'd stashed there. What's it doing?

    I'll set up a 4-segment clock. The artefact is about to...do something.

    Alien artefact [ ][ ][ ][ ]

Before the creature can react, he unslings the sack containing the device, and removes it. Parts of it are moving, and strange glowing lights streak across its surface. He lifts it above his head and smashes it into the twisted creature.

    Take Decisive Action. Progress move. [6, 1] vs 10. Strong hit, converted to
    weak hit for being in a bad spot. It’s worse than you thought: Make a
    suffer move (-2).

With all his strength, he rams the object into the creature's chest. As he does so, there's a blinding explosion, and Kylar is thrown across the chamber.

    Endure harm. -2 health. 

---

When he comes to, Buzzard is trying to lift him off the ground. He gives a moan.

> BUZZARD  
> Come on, flyboy, no more heroics. Let's get out of here.

> KYLAR  
> Talons... Ambush... Gotta warn...

He coughs. He takes a moment to clear his head, then there's another kick of adrenaline as he remembers where they are.

> KYLAR  
> Yeah, right. Let's go.

He staggers up, and the two of them run out of the chamber.

    Do they make it out of the vault before the pirates arrive?

    Fulfill your Vow. Progress Move. [3, 10] vs 8. Weak hit.
    Mark reward on quests legacy track (2 ticks).
    There's more to be done. If you Swear an Iron Vow, take full legacy reward.

As the two emerge from the portal and back on to the surface of the structure, Kylar stops.

> KYLAR  
> Wait, hold up. Buzzard, I've gotta tell you something.

> BUZZARD  
> Can this wait? I'm not going to unclench my glutes until I'm on the Herald.

> KYLAR  
> It's the Fire Talons. I picked up a transmission. Said they're coming for the Herald. They're on their way.

> BUZZARD  
> You sure? Of course you are. Damn!

> KYLAR  
> Look, I'll get you back to Pinnacle. In fact...

He takes out his knife.

> KYLAR  
> In fact, I swear upon iron that I'll get you back. OK? You gotta trust me.

    Swear an Iron Vow. Return Buzzard to Pinnacle Station. Dangerous. Roll
    +heart, +1 for connection. [4, 1] vs 5. Strong hit. +2 momentum.

The scavenger looks at him.

> BUZZARD  
> What, is this some kind of schoolboy crush you've got? Albatross, this is... this is a lot.

> KYLAR  
> What? No. I'm not even... Just listen to me. They're coming, and we're gonna make it back to Pinnacle. I swore on iron. Come with me. In the Sparrowhawk. Leave the Herald. 

    Compel. Roll +heart. [8, 3] vs 6. Weak hit. +1 momentum, but there's a
    demand or complication.
    Roll on action and theme tables. Persevere, trade.

Buzzard pauses a moment.

> BUZZARD  
> I can't go back, not yet. There's something I need, here in the Maelstrom. I'll come with you, but only if you help me first. You swore on iron, you said it. Help me first, and then Pinnacle.

    End a Session. I think having Buzzard as an ally could definitely help
    Kylar in his vow to get revenge on the Fire Talons, so I'll mark a tick.

    Develop Your Relationship. I've helped Buzzard, so I'll mark two boxes on
    her connection track.

    Next session will definitely involve Buzzard, so +1 momentum.

    What does Buzzard want in the Maelstrom? Will the Fire Talons catch up with
    them? Tune in next time!
