# Campaign Setup

## Cataclysm

We escaped the ravages of a catastrophic war.

Fleeing the devastation, we assembled our fleets and traveled to the Forge. In this final war, we were set upon by self-replicating nanomachines.

## Exodus

Mysterious alien gates provided instantaneous one-way passage to the Forge.

In the midst of the cataclysm, our ancestors found a strange metal pillar on our homeworld's moon. A map on the surface of this alien relic detailed the deep-space locations of the Iron Gates—massive devices which powered artificial wormholes. With no other options, the Exodus ships fled through the gates and emerged here in the Forge.

## Communities

Dangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans.

There are five Founder Clans, but some people are clanless. For them, life is incredibly hard.

## Iron

The Ironsworn bind their honor to iron blades.

## Laws

Much of the settled domains are a lawless frontier. Criminal factions and corrupt leaders often hold sway.

## Religion

Our faith is as diverse as our people.

Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears. Some idealize the natural order of the universe. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.

## Magic

Supernatural powers are wielded by those rare people we call paragons. These powers are born of ancient knowledge held by secretive orders.

## Communication and Data

Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements.

## Medicine

To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements.

## Artificial Intelligence

The vestiges of advanced machine intelligence are coveted and wielded by those in power.

## War

Professional soldiers defend or expand the holdings of those who are able to pay. The rest of us are on our own.

## Lifeforms

Many sites and planets are infested by dreadful forgespawn. These aberrant creatures threaten to overrun other life in the galaxy.

## Precursors

Over eons, a vast number of civilizations rose and fell within the Forge. Today, the folk we call grubs—scavenger crews and audacious explorers—delve into the mysterious monuments and ruins of those ancient beings.

## Horrors

Most insist that horrors aren’t real. Spacers know the truth. Are they the results of nanomachine infection?
