## Assets

### Glowcat

Your glowcat companion perceives the inner emotions and intentions of people and creatures in its vicinity, and embodies those impressions through the colors and intensity of its luminescent fur. When you Secure an Advantage by studying the glowcat’s reactions in a charged interaction, you may add +your companion’s health.

When you Compel, the glowcat’s reactions will help guide your approach. If the value of your action die is less than the glowcat’s health, you may reroll it.
